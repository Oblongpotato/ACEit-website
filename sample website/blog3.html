                                        Do You Want to Work Here?”</span></h2>
                                <p>Interviewers ask this question to determine and understand if you will be a valuable
                                    asset to their company and fit into the role well. This question is to find out if
                                    you will assist the existing team well and be able to run parallel with the
                                    company’s mission and vision. Every company/employer wants to recruit employees that
                                    enhance productivity.</p>
                                <p>But without a goal or purpose, there is none. The answer to the question ‘Why Do You
                                    Want to Work Here? conveys exactly that. The purpose of the candidate, how they will
                                    use their skills to enhance the company growth, and how you are the perfect fit for
                                    the particular job.</p>
                                <p>For example, if a company is conducting interviews to hire an efficient Software
                                    Engineer, they would want to hire someone that can understand what the company is
                                    trying to accomplish through its software. They will see if the candidate can
                                    balance perfectionism and pragmatism. And if they are not averse to mediocre tasks
                                    like bug fixing. These are all the points one needs to keep in mind before answering

                                    quick (try not to freeze up), your body posture should be right (sit with a straight
                                    back and a smile on your face), and answer confidently. Often the most underrated
                                    aspect of any interview, confidence is what helps us crack an interview even if we
                                    lack particular skills. Because as they say—skills can be taught, knowledge can be
                                    gained, but confidence is what comes from within.&nbsp;</p>

                                <h2 id="why-do-you-want-to-work-here-best-answer-examples">Why Do You Want to Work Here
                                    Best Answer Examples</h2>
                                <p><strong>Example 1</strong>: I have always been inspired by your company’s
                                    contribution to technology. You have changed the world of Calibration by creating
                                    the best CRMs this generation has used. Thanks to your innovations in the tech
                                    sector, business owners can now operate their companies on the go. Your software has
                                    made remote work easy across the globe and hence I want to contribute to this vision
                                    of your company by becoming a part of it as a Software Engineer.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p><strong>Explanation</strong>: Show them you have been following their organisation
                                    from quite a long and always admired their work. It will help you depict that you
                                    have genuine interest in the job.</p>
                                <p><strong>Example 2</strong>: I read an article a few months ago on your founder’s
                                    vision of changing the dynamics of the banking sector by using the best technology
                                    there is. Being a tech enthusiast myself, I felt very excited hearing about the
                                    project and that excitement grew when I saw there was a job opening in my field
                                    here. I would love to work for a visionary man who wants to take technology to the
                                    next level for a better world.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Tell them you remain up-to-date with the industry news
                                    and technologies. Hiring managers are more interested in people who are active in
                                    the industry.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p><strong>Example 3: </strong>I have been an avid user of your software for several
                                    years and the innovations and developments made in the space have always impressed
                                    and inspired me. The dedication of your team to ensure that the customers understand
                                    the product with the given demos is what I appreciate the most. It will be my honor
                                    to be a part of this innovative team and use my skill set to continue the brilliant
                                    work you are doing here.</p>
                                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The candidate didn’t just complement the company’s
                                    products — but also praised the quality of the products for both their reliable
                                    construction and their high-quality aesthetic. This insight into what makes these
                                    products so great is appealing to hiring managers, who can see that this candidate
                                    clearly knows and values what makes this company an all-around great place to work.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Example 4: </strong>My inclination toward technology and my keen interest in
                                    this field inspired me to gain knowledge that will add immense value to any project.
                                    I developed a skill set that will add value to companies building effective and
                                    efficient software to solve problems faced by companies in the IT sector. Having
                                    gone through your company profile, I observed how you are tirelessly working towards
                                    building software that aids this issue and hence I wish to contribute as an
                                    efficient software engineer.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> HR managers are undoubtedly one of the most
                                    hard-working people always wanting to make the company’s image better and better.
                                    Therefore, talking good about the company’s image can help in impressing the HR
                                    manager.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p><strong>Example 5: </strong>I have read great reviews of your company on Glassdoor
                                    and other sites and would be honored to work for you as a software engineer. I will
                                    feel pride in working for a company with such an amazing track record. I will use my
                                    skills and knowledge to contribute greatly to the projects and work tirelessly to
                                    achieve the company’s goals. I will be a valuable asset to your company and would
                                    leave no stone unturned to accomplish the team’s mission.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This response is perfect. It includes everything needed
                                    to make the decision. A candidate that is this enthusiastic about a company will do
                                    great things for it and add value that you can’t find anywhere else!</p>
                                <h2 id="why-do-you-want-to-work-here-answers-you-shouldnt-give-to-this-question">Why Do
                                    You Want to Work Here: Answers You Shouldn’t Give to This Question</h2>
                                <p>There are answers that can get you a job and then there are answers that can make all
                                    your efforts go in vain. The answer to the question ‘Why do you want to work here
                                    should not include:</p>
                                <p><strong>1. For the amazing salary package:</strong> No one wants to hire an employee
                                    who is only thinking about the paycheck. If you tell them that you are only inclined
                                    towards the money, they will not hire you. You should convince them that you will be
                                    a valuable asset to the company’s growth and not just join it for the sake of a good
                                    salary.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p><strong>2. I need this job desperately:</strong> It’s good to be honest but certainly
                                    not like this. This could reflect badly on your profile and can mean that the role
                                    does not interest you, and it’s only the job that you are after. Employers are
                                    looking for candidates with skills and not a sob story.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p><strong>3. It will be a good opportunity for my career:</strong> One of the cliches,
                                    that you should avoid using at all costs. This indicates that you are looking for a
                                    short-term opportunity and your end goal is something else. So why would an employer
                                    hire you for their organization?</p>
                                <p><strong>4. Cause this company seems really great to work for:</strong> Generic
                                    answers don’t stand out, and they are a missed opportunity to showcase your passion
                                    for the opportunity. Let’s take the time to talk about why you’d be uniquely
                                    qualified for the XYZ position using concrete examples that showcase your real-life
                                    experience.</p>
                                <p><strong>5. I don’t know, I saw your job opening and thought I should apply:
                                    </strong>&nbsp;Your goal is to show that you’re an ideal candidate, but it’s
                                    important not to come across as pushy. There has to be respect between you — a
                                    balance between showing interest and being overbearing.</p>
                                <p><strong>6. Because leave the rest, I am the best: </strong>While you might be trying
                                    to show a little confidence and ease the pressure, such quirky and bizarre answers
                                    sound not-so-funny to the interviewer.&nbsp;</p>
                                <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
                                <p>The job interview question, “Why do you want to work for us/with us/at our company?”
                                    is a popular question that hiring managers to ask. It also comes in many variations.
                                    Companies tend to ask this question because they want to make sure that you can see
                                    yourself doing this job for them for a long time. If you have no interest in the
                                    company, then why would they hire you?</p>
                                <p>While it might be one of the last questions towards the end of your interview, an
                                    inappropriate answer can prove to be unfavorable. Therefore, it’s quite crucial to
                                    answer perfectly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Here are a few important points to consider while tackling such questions:&nbsp;</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Always be thoughtful and thorough when answering interview questions.&nbsp;</li>
                                    <li>This is a chance to showcase your hard work, drive, and passion for the
                                        position.&nbsp;</li>
                                    <li>Make sure that you clearly articulate how you can help the company achieve its
                                        goals and maybe even exceed them!&nbsp;</li>
                                    <li>Use this opportunity to show off what you’ve accomplished in previous roles and
                                        why those experiences make you the perfect candidate for this position.&nbsp;
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>All in all — Why do you want to work here? There are good answers, bad answers, and
                                    then, the BEST answer. Pick yours wisely.</p>
