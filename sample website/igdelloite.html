            <article class="ibpage-article">
                <p><strong><u>Online Assessment Test</u></strong></p>
                <p>The first stage in the hiring process is an online assessment test. Those who pass this test will be
                    qualified for the next round. This round is categorized into three parts:</p>

                </ul>
                <p>This round can be skipped for the experienced folks depending upon the job profile and company
                    requirements.</p>
                <p><strong><u>Group Discussion</u></strong></p>
                <p>This is the second round of the Deloitte Selection Process, and candidates who passed the first round are
                    eligible to participate in this round. Deloitte frequently gives a case study based on a technical issue
                    that a business has encountered. You'd have 5 minutes to read it and then another 15 minutes to discuss
                    it with the group members. Moderators from Deloitte may also ask you questions regarding your solution.
                </p>
                <p><strong><u>Technical Interview</u></strong></p>
                <p>Candidates who clear the group discussion round are called for the face to face technical interview
                    round. Technical interviews are used to examine your technical skills – which is usually particular to
                    the role you are looking for – as well as to learn how you think, solve problems, and deal with
                    stressful situations.</p>
                <p>To assess your technical skills, you can anticipate being asked a variety of coding and non-coding
                    technical interview questions. Your technical knowledge and skills should meet the job criteria,
                    according to the interviewer. You may also be asked to write code. The interviewer will also assess your
                    problem-solving abilities. You'll be asked about your previous projects and work experiences, as well as
                    what you did and how you used technology and how successful you were. You should be able to describe
                    computer fundamentals to the interviewer, including OOPS, DBMS, CN, OS, and so on. It is vital to know
                    how to program in a specific language. Make certain you are conversant in at least one programming
                    language. You do not need to be fluent in all programming languages, but you should be familiar with at
                    least one, such as C++, Java, or Python.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The number of technical interviews will depend on how well you did in earlier rounds, your job profile,
                    your experience and the company's needs.</p>
                <p><strong><u>HR interview</u></strong></p>
                <p>An HR interview is conducted to assess your personality, strengths, weaknesses, and ability to handle the
                    role, as well as to check your background and determine if you're the proper fit for this position.
                    Candidates who pass the technical interview will advance to the HR round. They can also inquire about
                    Deloitte's history, such as when the company was founded, its aims, beliefs, and organizational
                    structure, among other topics. As a result, it's essential to be well-prepared for the HR interview.</p>
                <p>Understand the role completely, including what they anticipate from you, the skill sets you'll need, and
                    the qualifications you'll need. Examine your resume to make sure you've included all pertinent
                    information about yourself and that the information you've provided is true to the best of your
                    knowledge. Prepare to answer any questions that may be asked based on your resume. If you're asked a
                    question, be confident and honest in your response.</p>
                <p>We've put up a variety of frequently asked HR round interview questions that you might be asked during
                    your job interview.&nbsp;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tell me about yourself. (You can focus a little bit on your family history, your educational
                        qualifications, and then go on to your professional development. When talking about yourself,
                        attempt to include details that will convince the interviewer that you are qualified for the
                        position.)</li>
                    <li>Are you willing to relocate to various parts of India?</li>
                    <li>What are your expectations from this role?</li>
                    <li>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</li>
                    <li>Tell me about your projects and internships.</li>
                    <li>What made you want to find a new job? (This is a frequently asked question among experienced
                        professionals seeking a job change. Saying you're quitting your current job to pursue a promotion is
                        the simplest approach to react to this question. Make sure you're not criticizing or undermining
                        your current employer.)</li>

                    confident, and maintain a prominent position in your firm," you might remark. For seasoned
                    professionals, you can begin by saying, "Within the next five years, I want to be recognized as an
                    authority in this subject." The recruiter is solely interested in learning how long you expect to stay
