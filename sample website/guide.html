                    <div class="ib-iq-page__description">
                        <p>Technical interviews are a part of the hiring process for technical professionals: it's a highly focused and
                            rigorous process that assesses your technical skills, personality, and problem-solving abilities. In the same
                            vein as "show, don't tell," you need to demonstrate your skills to the interviewer, rather than just stating
                            them. The purpose of a technical interview isn't to trick you with riddles, brainteasers, or impossible
                            questions, but rather to see how you tackle real-world problems, such as those you may encounter once you get
                            hired. For the majority of us, technical interviews are a nightmare come true (with 3-4 interview rounds, remote
                            coding challenges, and even full-day onsite interviews). Even though they are intimidating, it is much easier
                            when you know what to expect and have invested time into interview preparation.</p>
                        <p class="ib-iq-page__description">Technical Interviews are notoriously unpredictable. As an applicant, you are
                            likely to encounter some of the standard technical interview questions from different categories (think of
                            behavioral questions, questions regarding education, situation-based questions, questions about one's technical
                            knowledge, experience, certifications, knowledge of project management systems, etc.). Here are a few:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Which programming languages do you use regularly in your work?</li>
                            <li>Do you have any technical certifications that make you qualified for this job?</li>
                            <li>Can you explain the most rewarding project you have worked on so far? Can you elaborate on your part in it?
                            </li>
                            <li>What steps do you take to ensure accurate estimates for a project?</li>
                            <li>Are you familiar with two-tier architecture? Explain its elements and uses.</li>

                            <p>Listed below are a few tips for interviewing for technical positions:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>An important step is to review the job description to determine what you need to study. This may involve
                                    learning data structures, coding in a specific language, or using business intelligence tools.</li>
                                <li>Explain your approach to solving problems and logical reasoning. This points out your problem-solving and
                                    critical thinking abilities to a hiring manager.</li>
                                <li>Do not hesitate to ask for more information if you do not understand the question. In case you do not know
                                    the answer to a question, tell the interviewer or ask probing questions to learn more. This may aid you in
                                    finding the right answer.</li>
                                <li>Attempt coding assignments and brain teasers to improve your programming skills.</li>
                            </ul>

                <p>Preparation is an important aspect of doing well during the job interview process, but it's difficult to plan ahead
                    when you don't know what to expect at interviews. Nowadays, technical interviews are extensive and rigorous. It is
                    especially true given that the hiring processes of many IT Companies can vary, making it most difficult for you to
                    know what to expect. Also, certain positions require specific programming languages, tools, and technologies. To
                    bridge the gap and alleviate your anxiety, we've created a popular set of guides to help you figure out what to
                    expect at tech interviews and how you can prepare for it. These guides are structured in an easy-to-follow,
                    step-by-step format that covers all aspects of software engineering interview preparation such as technical
                    interview rounds, interview questions, coding problems, and MCQs, as well as tips for interviewing.</p>
                <h3 class="ib-iq-section__heading">Programming (Language, Tools &amp; Technologies)</h3>
                <p>Programming is an inexplicably vast and growing field, which makes software development one of the most promising
                    careers. This makes software programming a very competitive field, where you must be proficient in various
                    programming languages, tools, and technologies to gain employment at top tech companies such as Facebook, Amazon,
                    Apple, Google, and so on. In light of that, how can you determine which language to choose and master for your tech
                    interview? Your choice should be based on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Career scope and job opportunities</li>
                    <li>Job requirements</li>
                    <li>Your learning objectives</li>
                    <li>Salary bands and Interest</li>
                    <li>Popular programming languages</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="ib-iq-section__heading">Company</h3>
                <p>Every individual is unique, so it's no wonder that no two companies are alike as well especially when it comes to the
                    hiring process. The same applies to tech companies, whether they are service based or product based. It's no secret
                    that technical interviews are difficult, especially when the hiring processes vary from company to company. However,
                    you can observe some general trends when interviewing many tech companies. Yet, that doesn't make hiring any less
                    confusing for job seekers. We have therefore outlined a few popular service based and product based companies along
                    with what to expect at interviews with these companies (like the technical interview rounds, coding questions, tips
                    for interviewing, and FAQs), in an effort to help you better understand how to prepare for tech interviews.</p>

                <h3 class="ib-iq-section__heading">MCQs</h3>
                <p>Many tech companies require candidates to take technical aptitude MCQs as part of their written exam (such as Tech
                    Mahindra, Capgemini, Wipro, Infosys, etc.). MCQs are among the most useful question types for assessing a
                    candidate's technical abilities across the board. Employers assess candidates using MCQs pertaining to different
                    programming languages, frameworks, development tools and technologies, and many more. They are not just simple go-to
                    questions. The key to framing these technical MCQs is to gain deep insights into candidates’ programming skills and
                    abilities. They also probe candidates' higher cognitive levels of thinking. In a short amount of time, they provide
                    a clear evaluation of a huge range of content. Feeling overwhelmed? Well, you shouldn’t! We've put together a set of
                    MCQs on a wide range of topics related to technical aspects such as DBMS MCQs, Operating System MCQs, HTML MCQs, and
                    more to make you stand out in many tech jobs.</p>
