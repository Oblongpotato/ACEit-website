    <hr>
    <p>There have been a lot of factors that have accelerated the company's rapid growth since the incorporation has
        included products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond Google's core search engine, that is, the Google
        Search. On the list of the most valuable brands, Google is ranked second by Forbes and fourth by Interbrand.</p>
    <p>Founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1998, Google LLC is an American multinational technology company which
        specializes in services and products related to the Internet, for instance, cloud computing, online advertising
        technologies, a search engine, software, and hardware. Google is one of the Big Five companies in the United
        States Information Technology industry, along with Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook. Google was
        reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. in 2015. Sundar Pichai is the CEO (Chief Executive
        Officer) of both Google and Alphabet.</p>

    <p>As we know that Google has a plethora of products to offer, I am sure that you are tempted to interview at Google
        and take a job! Their hiring process is a crucial part of their culture as they care deeply about their teams
        and the people who make them up. Building a more representative and inclusive workplace is the motive of
        Google’s hiring team, and that begins with hiring highly skilled people from various backgrounds. According to
        the Googlers, in order to truly build for everyone, a diversity of perspectives and experiences, and a fair <a
            href="https://careers.google.com/how-we-hire/" target="_blank">hiring process</a> is the first step in
        getting there.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Recruiter Connect</b>:
                    Recruiter can contact the candidate based on his/her profiles on Linkedin etc or if any of his/her known
                    has referred him/her to the company. However, it’s always best to message the recruiters via linkedin
                    and apply for the roles in the Career page of Google. If the candidate is good in DS &amp; Algo skills
                    it is highly recommended that he/she participate in Google Kickstart, this is Google’s hiring contest
                    which happens 6 times in a year. If the performance in those competitions is good the recruiters will
                    contact you easily.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Interview Rounds</b>:
                    Google has a total of 7 rounds. First two are telephonic interviews where the interviewer mostly asks
                    one medium or two easy Algo DS problems to the candidate and the candidate has 45 minutes to solve the
                    problems. However if the performance in Kickstart is good, these rounds are skipped and you directly
                    move to the next rounds. Next we have 5 onsite interviews out of which 4 are Algo DS interviews and 1 is
                    Googliness interview, Googliness interview is mostly a behavioral interview.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>After Interviews</b>:
                    Once the interviews are over, the recruiter will contact you with the feedback of the interviews, if the
                    performance is good and the interviews are cleared your profile goes to the different teams in Google
                    for the team matching round. In the team matching round the team understands your work style and your
                    interests and you can understand their requirements and the work expectations of the team.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Hired</b>:
                    Once the team and you both are comfortable and ready to start, the offer letter is prepared and shared
                    with you by the recruiters and you are HIRED!
                </li>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Telephonic Interviews (Two Rounds)</b> These are two 45 minute interviews on the phone where the
                    interviewer shares a Google Doc with the candidate and asks either a medium problem or two easy problems
                    of Algorithms and DS. It is expected that the candidate first explains the solution of the problem to
                    the interviewer and then codes the problem on google doc within the time of the interview. (Suggestion:
                    Practice writing the code on google doc if you have any interview coming up as it is a different
                    experience compared to writing the code in any text editor).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Algo DS Interviews (Three or Four Rounds)</b> These are 45 minute interviews where the interviewer
                    shares a Google Doc with the candidate and asks Medium to Hard problems of Algorithms and DS. It is
                    expected that the candidate first explains the solution of the problem to the interviewer and then codes
                    the problem on google doc within the time of the interview.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Googliness Interviews (One Round)</b> This is a new interview which Google started in 2020. It’s
                    mostly the behavioral interview to check the cultural fitness of the candidate in the company.

        <h2 class="text-center">Tips for Google Interview Preparation</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="m-b-20">Now that we know all about the hiring process of Google, here are a few tips which you can use to
            crack Google’s interview and get a job</p>

        <div class="p-h-20">
            <ol>
                <li class="m-b-10"><b>Understand the work culture at Google well</b> - It is always good to understand how
                    the company works and what are the things that are expected out of an employee at Google. This shows
                    that you are really interested in working at Google and leaves a good impression on the interviewer as
                    well.</li>
                <li class="m-b-10"><b>Be Thorough with Data Structures and Algorithms</b> - At Google, there is always an
                    appreciation for good problem solvers. If you want to have a good impression on the interviewers, the
                    best way is to prove that you have worked a lot on developing your logic structures and solving
                    algorithmic problems. A good understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms and having one or two good
                    projects always earn you brownie points with Amazon.</li>
                <li class="m-b-10"><b>Use the STAR method to format your Response</b> - STAR is an acronym for Situation,
                    Task, Action, and Result. The STAR method is a structured way to respond to behavioral based interview
                    questions. To answer a provided question using the STAR method, you start by describing the situation
                    that was at hand, the Task which needed to be done, the action taken by you as a response to the Task,
                    and finally the Result of the experience. It is important to think about all the details and recall
                    everyone and everything that was involved in the situation. Let the interviewer know how much of an
                    impact that experience had on your life and in the lives of all others who were involved. It is always a
                    good practice to be prepared with a real-life story that you can describe using the STAR method.</li>
                <li class="m-b-10"><b>Know and Describe your Strengths</b> - Many people who interview at various companies,
                    stay shy during the interviews and feel uncomfortable when they are asked to describe their strengths.
                    Remember that if you do not show how good you are at the skills you know, no one will ever be able to
                    know about the same and this might just cost you a lot. So it is okay to think about yourself and
                    highlight your strengths properly and honestly as and when required.</li>
                <li class="m-b-10"><b>Discuss with your interviewer and keep the conversation going</b> - Remember that an
                    interview is not a written exam and therefore even if you come up with the best of solutions for the
                    given problems, it is not worth anything until and unless the interviewer understands what you are
                    trying to say. Therefore, it is important to make the interviewer that he or she is also a part of the
                    interview. Also, asking questions might always prove to be helpful during the interview.</li>

                    <div class="m-t-5">There are a lot of high quality products which Google employees work on every day and
                        the amount of opportunity that Google presents its employees is humongous. Also, the work culture is
                        really good over there and the compensation offered to Google employees is on the higher end of the
                        standards of the Information Technology or Software Industry.</div>

                <li class="m-b-20">
                    <div class="bold">Are Google interviews hard?</div>
                    <div class="m-t-5">The toughness of an interview depends upon the amount of hard work you have put in to
                        prepare for them. Usually, the questions asked in a standard Google interview are of Easy to Medium
                        Level but it varies from person to person. Since the number of interview rounds range anywhere from
                        four to seven, it can be intimidating at times for a candidate. But if you are in, it is going to be
                        worth the effort.</div>

                    <div class="bold">Can I apply for multiple roles at Google?</div>
                    <div class="m-t-5">Yes, we can apply to any role that aligns with both our interests and skills. We are
                        evaluated against the requirements for each role and we can give interviews for different roles at
                        the same time. But one should note that within a span of thirty days, one can apply only for three
                        roles at Google.</div>

                    <div class="m-t-5">It is always nice to ask questions about the company’s culture and what is the
                        current technology using which the company makes its products. Asking about the future innovations
                        at Google also might be a good idea as it might make the interviewer believe that you are looking
                        forward to joining Google for a long time. You can also ask about the interviewer’s personal
                        experience at Google and what skills which you must develop before you join the job.</div>

                        confirmed by Google. Some of these qualities are as follows - <ul class="m-t-20"
