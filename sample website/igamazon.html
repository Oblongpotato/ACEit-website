        <hr>
        <p>Earth's most 'Customer Centric' company, Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue, Washington
            on July 5, 1994. Amazon is an American multinational technology company whose focus is on a large number of
            fields, for instance, E-Commerce, Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Digital Streaming, etcetera. It is
            considered to be one of the Big Five companies in the United States Information Technology industry, along with
            Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook.</p>
        <p>Amazon is renowned for its huge disruption of industries through technological innovation and mass scale. Being
            the world's largest online marketplace, AI assistant provider, and cloud computing platform, Amazon has a
            workforce of over six lakh employees, out of which over fifty thousand are Indians. It is the largest Internet
            company by revenue in the world right now and the second-largest private employer in the United States. Because
            of this, Amazon has the highest global brand valuation.</p>
        <p>Given the plethora of services that Amazon offers, it is pretty obvious that a lot of people want to join Amazon
            and be part of its evergreen culture. But what really is the secret sauce to Amazon’s humongous success? Well,
            if you ask this question to any of the employees at Amazon, we are pretty sure that everyone would unanimously
            say: <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles" target="_blank">'The Leadership Principles of Amazon'</a>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Recruiter Connect</b>:
                Best way to get noticed by Amazon recruiters is to maintain a good Linkedin profile and message recruiters.
                The candidate can also apply on the Amazon job portal but it is suggested that they also get a referral from
                an Amazon employee.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Interview Rounds</b>:
                Amazon conducts four interview rounds alongside an initial coding test. The coding test consists of DS/Algo
                problems. The first round is an HR round where they ask behavioral questions along with Computer Science
                theory questions to the candidate. The next three rounds focus solely on DS/Algo.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>After Interviews</b>:
                The recruiter contacts the candidate after these rounds and tells the verdict. They also look at the
                candidate’s leadership principles along with technical skills.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Hired</b>:
                Once the team and you both are comfortable and ready to start, the offer letter is prepared and shared with
                you by the recruiters and you are HIRED!
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
        <h3 class="text-center">Interview Rounds</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>HR Round(1 Round)</b> This is when they ask computer science theory and behavioural questions to the
                candidate. The questions may enquire about the candidate’s experience at previous companies and conflicts
                the candidate might have faced with colleagues/managers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Data Structures and Algorithms Rounds(3 Rounds)</b> The candidate is asked DS/Algo problems where
                production ready code might be expected from the candidate. It is not out of the realm of possibility to
                face minor behavioural questions here as well. The problems range from easy to hard but they are not the
                sole deciding factor for the final offer. Leadership principles also come into play here. The interviews are
                conducted on Amazon Chime.

        <h2 class="text-center">Tips for Amazon Interview Preparation</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="m-b-20">Now that we know about the rich heritage of Amazon, its work culture, and Leadership Principles, I
            am sure that you are tempted to interview at Amazon and take a job! Here are a few tips which you can use to
            crack Amazon's interview and get a job</p>

        <div class="p-h-20">
            <ol>
                <li class="m-b-10"><b>Understand the Leadership Principles Well</b> - As mentioned before, Amazonians take
                    great pride as far as their Leadership Principles are concerned. Therefore, knowing about these
                    principles and citing an instance or two where the candidate has applied them in real life will have a
                    positive impact on the interviewers. This leaves an impression that the candidate is genuinely
                    interested in working with the company.</li>
                <li class="m-b-10"><b>Be Thorough with Data Structures and Algorithms</b> - At Amazon, there is always an
                    appreciation for great problem solvers. If you want to have a good impression of the interviewers, the
                    best way is to prove that you have worked a lot on developing your logic structures and solving
                    algorithmic problems. A good understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms and having one or two good
                    projects always earn you brownie points with Amazon.</li>
                <li class="m-b-10"><b>Use the STAR method to format your Response</b> - STAR is an acronym for Situation,
                    Task, Action, and Result. The STAR method is a structured way to respond to behavioral-based interview
                    questions. To answer a provided question using the STAR method, you start by describing the situation
                    that was at hand, the Task which needed to be done, the action taken by you as a response to the Task,
                    and finally the Result of the experience. It is important to think about all the details and recall
                    everyone and everything that was involved in the situation. Let the interviewer know how much of an
                    impact that experience had on your life and in the lives of all others who were involved. It is always a
                    good practice to be prepared with a real-life story that you can describe using the STAR method.</li>
                <li class="m-b-10"><b>Know and Describe your Strengths</b> - Many people who interview at various companies,
                    stay shy during the interviews and feel uncomfortable when they are asked to describe their strengths.
                    Remember that if you do not show how good you are at the skills you know, no one will ever be able to
                    know about the same and this might just cost you a lot. So it is okay to think about yourself and
                    highlight your strengths properly and honestly as and when required.</li>
                <li class="m-b-10"><b>Discuss with your interviewer and keep the conversation going</b> - Remember that an
                    interview is not a written exam and therefore even if you come up with the best of solutions for the
                    given problems, it is not worth anything until and unless the interviewer understands what you are
                    trying to say. Therefore, it is important to make the interviewer that he or she is also a part of the
                    interview. Also, asking questions might always prove to be helpful during the interview.</li>

                        prepare for them. Usually, the questions asked in a standard Amazon interview are of Easy to Medium

                    <div class="m-t-5">It is always nice to ask questions about the company's culture and what is the
                        current technology using which the company makes its products. Asking about the future innovations
                        at Amazon also might be a good idea as it might make the interviewer believe that you are looking
                        forward to joining Amazon for a long time. You can also ask about the interviewer's personal
                        experience at Amazon and what skills which you must develop before you join the job.</div>

                        challenging problems on Data Structures and Algorithms. Having a good knowledge of fundamental
                        Computer Science Concepts like Object-Oriented Programming, Computer Networks, Operating Systems,
                        etc. might also be helpful.</div>
